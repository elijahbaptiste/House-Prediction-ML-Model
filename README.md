# House-Prediction-ML-Model
# Overview #

Welcome to the House Price Prediction Model repository! This project focuses on building a machine-learning model that predicts house prices based on the various features of a house (number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.). The model is designed to assist real estate professionals, homeowners, and prospective buyers in estimating property values.


# Data #
The dataset used for this project contains information about various houses, including features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. 
The data Dataset Used is From Kaggle.com and is available from the following link:

# Evaluation #
The model's performance is evaluated based on various metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

# Results #
The trained model achieves impressive results, as indicated by the evaluation metrics. The model was able to achieve predictions that were within $179,000 of the actual home prices. In the future, I would like to improve this, with the end goal being predictions that are within $10,000 of the actual home prices.
